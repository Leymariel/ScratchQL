<!--- Collect references and explain in one or two sentences how each reference is important to your project.--->
# References
- [Blockly API](https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/configure/advanced/using_blockly_apis)
    - This is the most important reference as it's the basics for how we would code the rest of our project
- [BlocklyLambdaCalculus](https://alexhkurz.github.io/BlocklyLambdaCalculus/)
    - We can use this as a reference to understand the JavaScript code we would need
