## Motivation 
Having all taken the database course and having worked with databases in the past for different projects such as research, we thought having a project centered around databases and making it easy to query a database for people who have little to no experience in SQL seemed very appealing to us. Also using softwares that have good UIs for accessing databases are not easily accessible to the public as companies such as Oracle and Amazon put them behind paywalls and are mainly supported for companies. Having something like ScratchQL would be very useful because it would allow for a user-friendly way to query databases as one would not have to learn SQL.
