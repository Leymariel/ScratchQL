## Instructions

### Downloading the Database
- [mySQL installation](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)
    - This contains instructions that helps with the installation of mySQL which we use to run the queries generated by our blocks.
    - Once this is downloaded you are able to run MySQL in your terminal
- [Sakila Database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila-installation.html)
    - This contains the zip file for the Sakila Database data dump and the downloading instructions
    - This is currently the database compatible with our code as we use the column names in the blocks.

### Generate a Query
- [ScratchQL Blockly](https://eshayamani.github.io/ScratchQL/design-blocks/)
    - Use our blockly interface to build a query with blocks
    - Once you are done, click the Generate Python button, which will output the SQL query that can be run in MySQL.
    - Copy the query to clipboard.

### Running the Query in MySQL
- Open your terminal and type mysql -u root -p
    - enter your password and login
- Once you are in MySQL, type USE sakila, which will take you to the database.
    - If you want to check to make sure you are in the database, type: 'SHOW TABLES;'
- From here, you can paste your query from blockly and it will show you the result.
